Yes, this list is exactly what we needed! Based on your previous questions about graded Pokemon cards, here are the key aspects we should focus on:
Essential Aspects for Graded Pokemon Cards:
Professional Grader (for PSA, BGS, CGC) - This is the official name instead of "Grading Company" that we were using

Set (Base Set, Jungle, etc.)
